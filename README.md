# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

Let two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and be completely connected. By definition, completely connected means that there is an edge for every pair of nodes. As the graphs have the same number of nodes, it would follow that they therefore have the same number of edges and degree sequences. It would also stand that the structure of these graphs have to be same, as there is simply no other way the edges could be arranged with the same number of nodes while being completely connected. Therefore two graphs of the same number of nodes and are completely connected must be isomorphic.
